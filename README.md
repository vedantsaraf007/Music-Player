**SimpleMP** or **Simple Music Player** is a simple and easy to use music player for free. It plays the most common music files (mp3, ogg, wma, wav) in a very simple way, just drag&drop your files or folders on the main screen and push play...

So why another music player? When I decided to make my own player back in 2005, the `Winamp 3` player was too buggy and very slow! I used my favorite programming language Delphi 5 and I learned a lot of new stuff. It was a great time and a few people in the Delphi community honored my work :-). Unfortunately, the interface of the FMOD sound library was no longer supported for Delphi, so I decided in 2007 to stop working on it.

In 2012 (after long time), I decided to make a new one!

Attention: This is a develop playground for me. It's a newer version of my old simple music player ([SimpleMP](http://jkarger.de/simple-music-player/)).

It's not perfect and many function not yet implemented.

***Use it with your own risk!***

## Simple functions

+ Plays **mp3**, **ogg**, **wma** and **wav** files (should be enough... or not?)
+ Drag&Drop your files or directories into the player (on the play list)
+ Drag&Drop files within the playlist
+ Add directories to the medialib (not yet finished)
+ Simple 10 band equalizer
+ Simple volume fade in and out (5 sec per default, can be changed in the settings file)
+ Shortcut keys if the player is on top and has the focus
	+ **[Space]** play or pause current file (if none is playing, the first selected file starts)
	+ **[Enter]** play selected files
	+ **[Del]** delete selected files from current playlist
	+ **[j]** play next file
	+ **[k]** play previuos file
	+ **[s]** shuffle mode on / off
	+ **[r]** repeat play list on / off
	+ **[m]** mute player on / off
	+ **[e]** show the equalizer
	+ **[l]** show the medialib
+ Flexible, responsive UI (different views for different window sizes)
+ You can link with the supported files (open with...)
+ Working as single instance, that means
	+ if you try start the player twice you get always the first started player
	+ if you link with supported media files, the player loads the new files and play the first file from the added files
+ Tooltip on playlist files
+ Dpi aware (per monitor)

## Releases

From time to time I'll build and publish a new pre-release which can be find here:

- [All](https://github.com/punker76/simple-music-player/releases)
- [v1.9.2](https://github.com/punker76/simple-music-player/releases/tag/v1.9.2)
- [v1.1.7.2](http://jkarger.de/simple-music-player/) the old `Delphi` release.

The solution can be compiled with the [Visual Studio Community Ed. 2015 or 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/
). I use the [paket](https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/) manager to install/restore or update the packages.
